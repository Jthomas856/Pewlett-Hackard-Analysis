# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to prepare Pewlett-Hackard for the upcoming “silver tsunami” where a large number of employees will be retiring. For this analysis we have two deliverables; determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We  want to focus on employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, and their current titles to determine the number of employees retiring per job title. From this information we want to create a metorship eligibility program to prepare employees to fill the roles of those retiring.

## Results

- Pewlett-Hackard has 90,398 employees eligible for retirement (employees born between 1952 and 1955), which makes up about 30% of the company's workforce.
- Many retirement eligible employyes have held multiple roles in their tenure at the company, so we had to further condense the data to only look at their most current role which will need to be backfilled.
- The top 3 titles of retirement eligible employees are Senior Engineer (29,414 employees), Senior Staff (28,254 employees) and Engineer (14,222 employees). These 3 roles account for about 80% of the retirement eligible employees.

- There are 1549 employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program, which consists of current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965. Majority of these employees hold senior titles.

## Summary
As the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact on Pewlett-Hackard the company is looking at filling 90,398 roles. The company only has 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program which creates a large deficit compared to the roles that need to be filled. Currently the company does not have enough employees qualified to mentor the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard employees.
